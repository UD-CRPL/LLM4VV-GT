It seems like there's a misunderstanding here. The given context is not directly convertible into code as it relates to OpenACC specification that is typically implemented by a compiler. It provides rules and recommendations about variable handling when using OpenACC clauses in relation to compute constructs. The code provided tests the use of `copyout` clause but doesn't test compiler implementations of the OpenACC.

Compiler testing is a complex task and usually involves testing a wide variety of code situations and edge cases, checking intermediate representation, assembly output, and the executable for correctness - this far exceeds the scope of a simple code snippet and involves knowledge about compiler design and testing techniques.

For compiler directives like OpenACC, typical tests would include:
1. Correct parallelization of loops within constructs.
2. Correct handling of memory transfers via `copy`, `copyin`, `copyout`, `create`, `present` clauses, etc.
3. Proper handling of `reduction` constructs.
4. Proper usage of device resources.
5. Correctness of the resulting output.

For testing the compiler's handling of OpenACC, the code snippet you provided which tests the `copyout` clause could be a small part of it. Similar test cases would need to be written and executed for different constructs and clauses, edge cases should be considered.

A comprehensive compiler testing also involves testing the error detection and messaging capabilities of the compiler. The compliance to the OpenACC specification can be tested by purposely writing incorrect or ill-formed OpenACC codes and checking compiler's responses against the expected behaviour according to the OpenACC specification.
