In the above code, we're making use of the OpenACC's "enter data" directive to first copy the array "a" from the host to the device, and later with the "copyout" clause to copy the array "b" from the device back to the host after it's been processed.

The 'acc_testsuite.h' header file is assumed to be a suite of utility functions and definitions that are common for these tests.

This test code generates random values for the array 'a', then runs a simple copy operation on the device using #pragma acc loops. After the computation is done on the device the result is copied back into array 'b' on the host.

Then we iteratively compare each element of 'a' and 'b'. If any differences are detected (beyond a preset precision level), we increment the error counter. The test will pass if this error is zero at the end of the test, indicating that the compiler has correctly implemented the data movement as per OpenACC directives.

The last part of the code is testing this function for a certain number of test calls (assumed to be defined in the testsuite code as 'NUM_TEST_CALLS') and accumulates 'failcode' for that number of tests. 

It should be noted that OpenACC specification should be implemented correctly in the compiler for the directives used in code to execute as expected. In case of incorrect implementation, this test may fail to perform as expected and may throw unexpected results or errors.
