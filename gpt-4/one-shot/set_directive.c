Correct, this C code will indeed validate and verify the compiler implementation of the OpenACC specification concerning the `copyout` clause. This code essentially:

- Creates two arrays `a` and `b`, fills `a` array with random values and initializes `b` to zero.
- Copies array `a` into GPU memory for computation.
- Uses the OpenACC `copyout` clause to copy the modified `b` array back to CPU memory throughout the `kernels` directive encompassing the computation.
- After all computations are done, it then compares the values in `b` and `a` to verify their equality. 

This is a good method to test the correctness of the `copyout` clause being used in an OpenACC parallelizable directive inside a data region. A value other than zero returned from the main function indicates that there are errors in `copyout` clause processing by the OpenACC compiler. 

Such kinds of tests are part of a comprehensive validation suite to ensure a correct OpenACC compiler implementation and they are vital for verifying parallel computing code correctness.
