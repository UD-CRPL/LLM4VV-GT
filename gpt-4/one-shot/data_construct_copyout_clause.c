Your code seems fine, however, there are a couple of things that need to be noted:

1. Ensure that the `acc_testsuite.h` is the correct header file that has the definitions of `real_t`, `n`, `SEED`, `PRECISION`, and `NUM_TEST_CALLS`. If not, you would need to define them in your test code.

2. Define the value for `n` before allocating memory for `a` and `b`. Also, remember to deallocate the memory after it is used to avoid memory leaks.

3. In the copyout clause, ensure that the array `b` is properly copied from the device to the host. 

The code constructs the kernels and data constructs properly and should give you the correct output if used correctly. 

Remember that testing is important to validate that your parallel application is computing correct results. Make sure to thoroughly test the code in all predictable scenarios to ensure its robustness. Also, ensure that the OpenACC directives are resulting in significant performance improvement in your application.
