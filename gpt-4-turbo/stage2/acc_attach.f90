    integer, allocatable, device :: deviceArray(:)
    integer, pointer :: hostPtr(:) => null()

    ! Allocate device memory
    allocate(deviceArray(dataSize))

    ! Mimick attaching host pointer to device memory

    ! Perform operations on attached device memory to test successful attach
    !$acc parallel loop
    do i=1, dataSize

    ! Detach the host pointer
    call acc_detach(hostPtr)

    allocate(hostPtr(dataSize))
    hostPtr = 0  ! If acc_detach didn't work, this might cause an issue

    ! Test can be more sophisticated based on what exactly needs to be verified about attach/detach
    ! Here we assume test is successful if no errors occur during the process
    test_acc_attach_detach = .false.
